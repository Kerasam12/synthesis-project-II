# Synthesis Project II
## Anomaly Detection on Networks

`This project is now in a preliminary phase.`

We will be using the [Elliptic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ellipticco/elliptic-data-set?resource=download), which can be found in [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) to develop a method that is able to detect anomalous activities in financial networks.
